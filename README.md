# My Trustees API

This is an Express application that takes an address, geocodes it using Googleâ€™s API, and returns the school division and ward for that address, if found.

It uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/).

```
yarn install
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY yarn start
```

## Tests

```
yarn test
